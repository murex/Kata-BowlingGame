# TCR - Go Version

# About

This is a [Go](https://golang.org/) implementation of TCR.

It is still at an early stage of development.

It provides the same features as [TCR shell](../tcr_shell/tcr_shell.md)
version but might still not be as robust.

For this reason it is currently not used by default in our katas,
but you can still give it a try if you wish.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Have a [git client](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed
- Have a fully operational Java or C++ development environment

### Launching TCR Go Version

#### C++ version of the kata

```shell
> cd cpp
> env TCR_ENGINE=go ./tcrw
```
#### Java version of the kata

```shell
> cd java
> env TCR_ENGINE=go ./tcrw
```

### Command Line Options

Refer to [TCR Go CLI Documentation](./doc/tcr.md)
