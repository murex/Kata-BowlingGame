# Randori in Pairs

This format is the same as the [Randori Kata](RandoriKata.md) but done in Pairs.

The goal is to increase learning and practice time.

To have a better engagement with the team, it is better to walk in the room, observe what they are doing, and step in when needed. Basically, you need to give them a hint, ask a question if you see them going in the wrong direction, or unblock if they are feeling lost and afraid of not being able to reach a solution.
