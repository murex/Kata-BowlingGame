## How to prepare a successful mob session

Trying mobbing for the first time can be a great experience. It can also be very disappointing if it does not work as expected. Here is a list of points that make mob sessions a success or a failure. Pick the topic and prepare accordingly!

### Mob sessions are successful when

* There was a lot of knowledge sharing happening during the session
* There was a fast set of regression tests around the code being changed
* You worked on a valuable story
* You had a clear goal for the session
* There was a lot of design during the session
* Someone had already scratched the surface of the topic
* You could continue swarming or pairing on the issue after the mob
* You could use the mob to find to a new assignee

### Mob sessions are not successful when

* You lost time to setup a working environment
* You lost time to chose a topic
* You did not pick a topic before the session
* You suffered from slow and long compilations times...
* You spent 2 hours sharing progress... to continue solo just after!
* The mob is full of experts with non-overlapping area of expertise
  who spent a lot of time to fill the knowledge sharing debt
